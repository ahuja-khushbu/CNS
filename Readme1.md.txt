# Shift Cipher Experiment

## 1. Aim:
To understand and perform the encryption and decryption process of the **Caesar Cipher** (Shift Cipher). In this experiment, you will generate ciphertext, choose a key (shift value), and decrypt the text to verify that it matches the original plaintext.

## 2. Procedure:

1. Generate the ciphertext using a shift of your choice.
2. Copy the generated ciphertext into Part 3 for decryption.
3. Choose a key (shift value) that correctly generates the plaintext.
4. Verify the result by clicking the decrypt button and ensuring the output matches the plaintext.

## Potential Viva Questions - Caesar Cipher:

1. **What is the Caesar Cipher?**
   - The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

2. **Who invented the Caesar Cipher?**
   - It was named after Julius Caesar, who used it for secret communication.

3. **How does the Caesar Cipher work?**
   - Each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D'.

4. **What is the key in the Caesar Cipher?**
   - The key is the number of positions each letter is shifted.

5. **Can the Caesar Cipher encrypt both uppercase and lowercase letters?**
   - Yes, though it's usually applied to one case in classical versions.

6. **What is the main weakness of the Caesar Cipher?**
   - It has only 25 possible keys, making it easy to break with brute force.

7. **How do you decrypt a Caesar Cipher?**
   - Decryption reverses the encryption process by shifting letters back by the same number of positions.

8. **How does the Caesar Cipher handle non-alphabetic characters?**
   - Non-alphabetic characters are typically left unchanged.

9. **Is the Caesar Cipher secure in modern cryptography?**
   - No, it is easily broken using brute force or frequency analysis.

10. **How can the Caesar Cipher be improved?**
    - One improvement is the Vigen√®re Cipher, which uses multiple Caesar shifts.

# Mono-alphabetic Cipher

## 1. Aim:
To understand the encryption and decryption process using a **Mono-alphabetic Cipher**, where each letter in the plaintext is substituted with a unique letter.

## 2. Procedure:

1. Generate your own plaintext and substitute each letter with a random one to create ciphertext.
2. Avoid using pre-generated ciphertext to enhance understanding.
3. Use a substitution table to map letters during encryption and reverse the process for decryption.

## Potential Viva Questions - Mono-alphabetic Cipher:

1. **What is a mono-alphabetic cipher?**
   - A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext maps to a unique letter in the ciphertext, and the substitution is fixed throughout.

2. **How does encryption and decryption work?**
   - Encryption replaces plaintext letters using a substitution table, while decryption reverses the process.

3. **What are the strengths and weaknesses?**
   - Strengths: Easy to implement. Weaknesses: Vulnerable to frequency analysis.

4. **What role does frequency analysis play?**
   - It helps decrypt the cipher by matching letter frequencies in ciphertext to common plaintext frequencies.

5. **What is the key in a mono-alphabetic cipher?**
   - The key is the unique substitution of each letter, typically generated by randomly rearranging the alphabet.

6. **How can you break a mono-alphabetic cipher?**
   - By using frequency analysis and looking for common word patterns.

7. **How is it related to the Caesar Cipher?**
   - The Caesar Cipher is a special case of the mono-alphabetic cipher with a fixed shift.

8. **What are some use cases for mono-alphabetic ciphers?**
   - They may be used for simple encryption in games or puzzles but are not suitable for secure communication.

9. **What is a substitution table?**
   - A mapping of plaintext letters to ciphertext letters used for encryption and decryption.

10. **Difference between mono-alphabetic and homophonic substitution ciphers?**
    - In mono-alphabetic, each letter is substituted by one letter, while homophonic ciphers use multiple symbols for the same plaintext letter.
